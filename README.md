## Major Bugs and Fixes

1. **Buttons Staying Blue After Click**
   - **Issue**: On smaller devices, the buttons stayed blue after being clicked.
   - **Solution**: Added CSS rules to prevent this behavior by setting the focus state of the buttons.

2. **Redirecting to 404 Page on Button Click**
   - **Issue**: The page kept redirecting to the 404 page whenever a button was clicked, even when the correct answer was selected.
   - **Solution**: Fixed the bug by ensuring the `checkAnswer` function was properly defined and accessible in the script.

3. **Undefined Functions Causing Errors**
   - **Issue**: `checkAnswer` and other functions were not being recognized, causing the game to crash.
   - **Solution**: Ensured all necessary functions were defined and exposed to the global scope if needed.

4. **Missing HTML Elements Causing Script Failures**
   - **Issue**: The script was failing because certain HTML elements were not found.
   - **Solution**: Added checks to ensure all elements were properly referenced.
